📰 Multi-Label Topic Classification of News Articles An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for multi-label topic classification of news articles, covering data collection, preprocessing, training, ONNX optimization, and deployment-ready inference. This project is designed for research, production, and deployment scenarios, with large trained models stored externally for efficiency. 🚀 Project Highlights 🔖 Multi-label text classification (one article → multiple topics) 🧠 Transformer-based architecture ⚡ Optimized ONNX inference 🧩 Modular pipeline (scraping → training → inference) 🌐 Deployment-ready (Hugging Face / API friendly) 📦 Large models stored externally (GitHub-safe)
