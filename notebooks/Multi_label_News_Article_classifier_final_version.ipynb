State communications watchdog Roskomnadzor restricted access to BBC Russia\\u2019s online presence, as well as Radio Liberty and the Meduza media outlet, the state-owned Russian RIA news agency reported on Friday. On Friday, Globalcheck, a service that tracks internet censorship in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), reported that the availability of the entire BBC website was at 17% of normal levels in Russia, which suggested some services had been blocked. Later on Friday, the BBC shared methods to circumvent the ban, including the Pisphon app or the Tor browser. BBC Russia also reported that Meta, formerly known as Facebook, also appeared to be blocked, as was Google Play. The signs the BBC was being blocked emerged hours after the BBC\\u2019s decision to revert to a mostly obsolete form of broadcasting, broadcasting four hours of its world service, read in English, to Ukraine and parts of Russia each day. \\u201cIt\\u2019s often said truth is the first casualty of war,\\u201d BBC director general Tim Davie said in announcing the move on Thursday. \\u201cIn a conflict where disinformation and propaganda is rife, there is a clear need for factual and independent news people can trust \\u2026 millions more Russians are turning to the BBC.\\u201d The German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle also reported in Russian that the BBC site was not working in Russia. The BBC\\u2019s shortwave radio broadcast can be found on 15735 kHz from 4pm to 6pm and on 5875 kHz from 10pm to midnight, Ukraine time. The BBC\\u2019s move to bring back shortwave came days after Russia launched two missiles on Kyiv\\u2019s TV tower, killing five people and knocking out some access to news and broadcasts. Ukraine\\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, wrote on Twitter that the Kremlin was preparing to cut off communications and spread \\u201cmassive fake messages that the country\\u2019s leadership has given up\\u201d. Russia has clamped down on public dissent at home, while Kremlin-backed media organisations such as RT have been pulled internationally. The Kremlin has complained about the BBC\\u2019s coverage of the invasion, with Russia\\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claiming without evidence that the BBC \\u201cplays a determined role in undermining the Russian stability and security\\u201d. Zakharova also claimed Russia had been the victim of \\u201cunprecedented information terrorism\\u201d that was \\u201ccreating hysteria around Ukrainian events\\u201d. The BBC has reported huge increases in its audiences in Ukraine and Russia since the invasion began. In the last week of February, viewership of BBC\\u2019s Ukrainian language website more than doubled from a year earlier to 3.9 million visitors. Its Russian-language website has reached a record 10.7 million visitors over the past week, more than tripling its weekly 2022 average. Shortwave radio uses frequencies that can travel long distances and are accessible on portable radios, making it the go-to method to reach listeners in conflict zones throughout history. Shortwave was used extensively in Europe to broadcast propaganda during the second world war, and usage peaked during the cold war. But as radio technology developed, along with the mass adoption of online news, shortwave fell out of favour around the world. After 76 years, the BBC World Service ended its shortwave broadcast to Europe in 2008.

Dame Alison Rose issued a public statement on Thursday and wrote a letter to Farage apologising for the way the NatWest subsidiary had handled its decision to cut ties with the Brexit campaigner. It came after a series of interventions by the prime minister and senior members of his cabinet, and more than two weeks after Farage first disclosed that his accounts had been closed by Coutts because it no longer wanted him as a client. On Thursday night, Farage welcomed the apology from Rose but said it was only \\u201ca start\\u201d and claimed she had been forced into it by the Treasury. An internal report had described Farage as a \\u201cdisingenuous grifter\\u201d who promotes \\u201cxenophobic, chauvinistic and racist views\\u201d. After obtaining a copy and releasing it to the press, Farage had described the dossier as a \\u201cprejudiced, nasty document\\u201d. Rose said the comments, prepared for Coutts\\u2019 wealth reputation risk committee, \\u201cdo not reflect the view of the bank\\u201d. She added: \\u201cNo individual should have to read such comments and I apologise to Mr Farage for this.\\u201d However, she stopped short of reinstating Farage as a Coutts client, instead reiterating an offer to open a basic account for him at NatWest. It follows days of mounting public and political pressure, with Rishi Sunak intervening to warn it \\u201cwouldn\\u2019t be right if financial services were being denied to anyone exercising their right to lawful free speech\\u201d. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, called the decision \\u201csinister\\u201d. The government announced on Thursday that it would force banks to \\u201cexplain and delay\\u201d any decision to close accounts. Andrew Griffith, economic secretary to the Treasury, said \\u201cbanks occupy a privileged place in society\\u201d and must allow \\u201ceveryone to express themselves freely\\u201d without fear of losing their access to banking. It also ordered the Financial Conduct Authority to begin a review of the rules governing how banks treat \\u201cPolitically Exposed Persons\\u201d (Peps) such as Farage over the next two months. Lasting up to a year, the review will examine whether to ease the tough rules inherited from the EU on domestic Peps while maintaining them on foreigners with bank accounts in the UK, in line with international standards. Before Farage made the dossier public, reports had cited sources at Coutts saying that the decision to \\u201cunbank\\u201d Farage was purely because his account had fallen below its \\u201cwealth limit\\u201d, which requires customers to borrow or invest at least \\u00a31m or hold \\u00a33m in savings. The former politician fell below this threshold after his mortgage expired this year. However, Coutts\\u2019 reputation committee report also said Farage posed a risk, accusing him of being \\u201cseen as xenophobic and racist\\u201d and of making remarks that are \\u201cdistasteful and appear increasingly out of touch with wider society\\u201d. On his GB News programme on Thursday night Farage accused Rose of being forced into an apology by the Treasury. He said: \\u201cIn life it is always good to get an apology, so thank you Dame Alison for apologising. What I\\u2019ve actually been told quietly, privately, is that you were forced into doing this by the Treasury. \\u201cBut at least you\\u2019ve done it, I suppose. But the whole letter smacks of \\u2018not me, guv, I mean I\\u2019m just the chief executive, I mean, don\\u2019t blame me for what the banks under my direct control are doing\\u2019.\\u201d He said there were thousands in the same position as him, as he vowed to battle on. \\u201cI\\u2019m afraid I can\\u2019t just walk away from this. I\\u2019ve started this, and I\\u2019ve got to continue. So thank you for the apology. It\\u2019s a start, but it\\u2019s no more than that.\\u201d Rose had said it was not the bank\\u2019s policy \\u201cto exit a customer on the basis of legally held political and personal views\\u201d. \\u201cBoth freedom of expression and access to banking are fundamental to our society,\\u201d she said. \\u201cDecisions to close an account are not taken lightly and involve a number of factors including commercial viability, reputational considerations, and legal and regulatory requirements.\\u201d Announcing the new account closure rules, which will come into effect later this summer and are likely to be among the first post-Brexit changes to banking rules, Griffith said: \\u201cFreedom of speech is a cornerstone of our democracy, and it must be respected by all institutions. \\u201cThese changes will boost the rights of customers \\u2013 providing real transparency, time to appeal and making it a much fairer playing field.\\u201d The changes will increase the notice period for closing accounts to 90 days \\u2013 giving customers more time to challenge a decision through the Financial Ombudsman Service. Banks will also be required to spell out why they are terminating an account \\u2013 increasing transparency for customers and aiding their efforts to overturn decisions. The Treasury said the changes could only be made due to new powers in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023. The proposed new rules follow a call for evidence launched in January, after PayPal\\u2019s temporary suspension last year of several accounts, including that of Toby Young, the social commentator and director of the Free Speech Union. The Treasury said the changes were needed to \\u201censure the right balance is being struck between protecting customers, and providers\\u2019 rights to manage commercial risk\\u201d.\",\n          \"There were negatives, of course. Shall we focus on the negatives? Shall we dwell on the frailties a little? The uncharacteristic errors, the double faults, an occasional scruffiness at the net, the frequent slumps in intensity? Shall we marvel at the fact that the lowest-ranked player in the tournament earned more break points (11) than one of the greatest players of his generation (10)? Shall we warn, in a tone of affected sternness, that the defending champion will have to raise his game on this evidence? Of course we shall, because this is Carlos Alcaraz, and because there is an entire cottage industry built around maintaining the idea that Alcaraz is in a state of crisis at all times, a state of crisis so acute that it is necessary to feign round-the-clock concern for him. We just want to see all that rich talent fulfilled. That\\u2019s all it is. Sincerely and genuinely. And definitely not a weirdly prurient interest in his holidays to Ibiza, or whether him and Emma Raducanu are, you know. Just the talent. Thinking of the talent here. And of course the illicit pleasure and enduring appeal of Alcaraz is that he so readily indulges these desires. He emotes. He misses a lot. He pulls off spectacular acrobatic winners immediately after missing a lot. He lives without inhibitions or regrets. Alcaraz is essentially a magic-eye puzzle you can read in whatever way you want, and after the sweat-drenched psychodrama of Fabio Fognini on Monday night there were more danger signs in his 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 win over Britain\\u2019s Oliver Tarvet; if you really, really wanted to see them. The more prosaic truth is that Alcaraz was playing himself as much as he was playing the world No 733 from St Albans. Tarvet is one of those classic British folk heroes the early rounds of Wimbledon always seem to throw up, complete with shaggy-dog backstory and tabloid headline-friendly name. And if Alcaraz was expecting an easy afternoon of Tarvet practice, he quickly discovered that it would be anything but easy shaking off this particular Tarvet from his back. Certainly Tarvet seemed to get an early read on the Alcaraz serve, used his speed and coverage to trade happily from the baseline, rode the early waves of noise from the home crowd. Some of his passes were sublime. Above all he looked untroubled, unfazed, hyper- confident, like a crypto-billionaire who had won a game against Carlos Alcaraz in a charity auction. \\u201cGood serve,\\u201d he called out at one point as his opponent pinned him with a vicious delivery to the body. Alcaraz shot him a look as if to say: yeah. Obviously it\\u2019s a good serve. I\\u2019m Carlos Alcaraz. Who are you again? But of course no read on Alcaraz\\u2019s serve is ever going to rival the read he has on yours. And though both men kept swinging, while Tarvet created break points and saved others, the only real jeopardy here was of the confected variety. Tarvet probably played the best match of his life, and in the end it was like bringing a sword to a sword fight when your opponent has about six far superior swords. There was a sadistic relish to the way Alcaraz kept teasing him with the drop shot, occasionally missing, mostly succeeding. But of course the drop shot, such a staple of the Alcaraz game, is also a stick to beat him with. Missing it costs one point, exactly the same as putting a forehand an inch long. And yet some misses are clearly more moral than others. For his detractors Alcaraz\\u2019s missed drop shots will always be taken in evidence against him, proof of his essential flimsiness. So, once again, we must deal with the principal charge. Alcaraz is inconsistent. It\\u2019s true, because everyone says so, to the point where it has basically passed into objective fact. Like the objective fact that Alcaraz has a win percentage of 90% so far this year, has won five of his six finals, is slowly putting together one of the greatest seasons in the modern era. His grass-court record stands comparison with the all-timers. This is the sort of inconsistency all but one of his rivals would dream of. But of course this is a stylistic as much as it is an empirical judgment. It is true that there is a big gulf between his highest and lowest levels. That he occasionally loses to people like Botic van de Zandschulp. That towards the end of last season and for a small portion of this he has looked a little unmoored, a little rattled. And yet how much of this reaction stems from a desire to see crisis, to armchair-analyse, to draw a straight line from his personal choices to his tennis as a way of justifying our interest in his personal choices? In a way, Alcaraz\\u2019s entire game serves as a kind of rejoinder to all this. This is, remember, still a player with just 34 tour games on grass, still adding levels and tones to his game, still learning how to master the mental side, still trying to work out exactly how famous he wants to be. In the meantime he\\u2019s going to keep going for the lines, keep going to Ibiza, keep trying the drop shot, keep embracing the chaos, because that\\u2019s the only way he knows. What if he misses, you scream. Fine. But what if he doesn\\u2019t?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 65,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Energy']\",\n          \"['Climate', 'Health']\",\n          \"['Politics']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Guardian\",\n          \"BBC\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 95729,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/11/gamechanging-breast-cancer-pill-to-be-offered-on-nhs-in-england-and-wales\",\n          \"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/20/with-all-his-plans-in-tatters-rishi-eyes-some-reshuffle-lolz\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"section\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"law\",\n          \"media\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

And why not? They had come within a single refereeing call at the breakdown of claiming a British &amp; Irish Lions series win. They had hammered the world champion Springboks in Johannesburg. They had shown great chutzpah to beat Argentina after the hooter and they still carried the glow of last November\\u2019s win over England. This was a side developing shape and steel, a side capable of the sublime, a side beginning to coax long-dormant fans back to the code while tempting home several stars who had crossed to rugby league. This tour was supposed to confirm, unequivocally, that the Wallabies were back. Instead, they\\u2019ve gone backwards after a sorry performance against Ireland in Dublin where they received a 46\\u201319 shellacking that still managed to flatter them on the scoreboard. This result also confirms their status as a B-tier rugby team. No matter what happens against France in Paris next week, they will leave Europe ranked outside the top six on World Rugby\\u2019s charts, consigning them to the second pot when the 2027 World Cup draw takes place next month. The implications are stark: if the Wallabies want to reach the latter stages of their own tournament on home soil, they will have to knock over one of the giants, a task that, on current evidence, feels well beyond them. Too often in Dublin they looked like a side searching for someone else to take control: to claim the high ball, to marshal the defensive line, to calm a frantic moment, to dictate where the next five minutes should be played. Ireland didn\\u2019t overwhelm them physically or tactically. They simply leaned on the most obvious pressure points \\u2013 contestable kicks, structured phase play, tempo changes \\u2013 and trusted that the Wallabies would crack first. And they did. Australia coughed up possession from their own lineout on six occasions \\u2013 four times inside Ireland\\u2019s 22. Their ineptitude under the high ball has only worsened after similar struggles against England and Italy over the past fortnight. They\\u2019re playing like a team that has run out of energy, which is deeply concerning given they should be entering a new chapter as they gear up for that home World Cup in less than two years. What on earth are they going to do between now and then? First things first: they need to back someone, anyone, at fly-half. James O\\u2019Connor is a supremely gifted athlete. He looks the part too. His socks are down around his ankles, his angular jaw barks instructions to teammates as his sinewy arms wave about. But he is not the metronome this team requires. His inability to marshal the backline into something resembling a cohesive structure was telling. Not that this is O\\u2019Connor\\u2019s fault. In an ideal world, the 35-year-old who made his Test debut 17 years ago would have been watching this match like the rest of us. But Tane Edmed is far from the finished product, and Carter Gordon, while rediscovering his groove in the code, is sidelined with a neck injury. What Schmidt would give for a player like South Africa\\u2019s Handr\\u00e9 Pollard or England\\u2019s George Ford, two fly-halves who have copped their share of criticism for lacking razzle-dazzle, yet provide the one quality Australia are crying out for: control. Australia already have plenty of excitement and instinct and broken-field brilliance. What they\\u2019re missing is a first receiver who dictates the tempo of a Test match, who can put his studs on the ball and slow things down, who can take the sting out of the contest rather than add to the chaos. Under Schmidt, Australian rugby is steadier, but still too dependent on the sting. For Schmidt, this is a version of Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho\\u2019s undersized blanket problem: tug the defence into shape and the attack loses fluidity; focus on structure and the spark disappears; lean on spark and the control evaporates. Every time Australia cover one area, another is left exposed. The cruel irony is that this team\\u2019s ceiling remains genuinely high. But the floor keeps dropping out from beneath them. They don\\u2019t need to reinvent themselves, they need reliability, leadership and a spine that doesn\\u2019t buckle under pressure. The tour was supposed to be a statement of intent. Instead, it has served as a sobering reminder of how far behind the leading nations Australia still sit. Schmidt will speak of learnings and combinations and growth \\u2013 and some of that will be true \\u2013 but he knows better than anyone that this team requires more than incremental improvement. It needs identity, clarity and, crucially, a fly-half who can turn talent into Test-match shape. In the end it\\u2019s the clarity that will hurt most. Australia are not on the cusp of something; they are adrift from it. The raw materials are there, but the polish, the precision, the ruthlessness that defines the very best sides remains absent.\",\n          \"Former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte has said he will accept responsibility for his government\\u2019s so-called \\u201cwar on drugs\\u201d in a video message filmed on board a plane shortly before he was taken into the custody of the international criminal court (ICC). \\u201cWhatever happened in the past, I will be the front of our law enforcement and the military. I said this already, that I will protect you, and I will be responsible for everything,\\u201d he said. The video message, which appeared to have been filmed on board the aircraft that brought him to the Netherlands to face charges of crimes against humanity, were his first comments to the Philippines public since his dramatic arrest on Tuesday. Dressed in a plain white shirt, and speaking to the camera, he said: \\u201cThis will be a long legal proceeding. But I say to you, I will continue to serve the country. So be it. If that is my destiny. Thank you\\u201d. Duterte has previously said he offered \\u201cno apologies, no excuses\\u201d for his bloody anti drugs crackdowns which activists say may have killed as many as 30,000 people. Duterte\\u2019s plane landed at Rotterdam airport at just before 5pm local time on Wednesday, and he was transferred to a detention unit on the Dutch coast. In a statement the ICC confirmed it had taken custody of the former leader, with the court\\u2019s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, calling it \\u201ca crucial step in our continuous work to ensure accountability for the victims of the most serious crimes under ICC jurisdiction.\\u201d Duterte is the first former leader of an Asian country to be served an arrest warrant filed by the ICC. In a statement the ICC said its chamber, composed of three judges, had assessed material submitted by office of the prosecutor and found reasonable grounds to believe that Duterte is \\u201cindividually responsible as an indirect co-perpetrator for the crime against humanity of murder, allegedly committed in the Philippines between 1 November 2011 and 16 March 2019.\\u201d A hearing will be scheduled \\u201cin due course\\u201d for Duterte\\u2019s initial appearance before the court, it said, which will confirm his identity and the language in which he is able to follow the proceedings. It is not clear when a trial will begin. Supporters of the former leader gathered at The Hague Penitentiary Institution, waiving the Philippines flag and chanting \\u201cbring him back\\u201d. While rights experts and victims\\u2019 families have been overjoyed by the news of Duterte\\u2019s arrest, the former leader retains a strong support base, especially in the south of the country. \\u201cI am OK, do not worry,\\u201d Duterte, who will turn 80 this month, said in the video message. His daughter, Sara Duterte, the vice-president, also arrived in The Hague on Wednesday evening to offer support. Lawyers for Duterte on Wednesday filed a petition on behalf of his youngest daughter, Veronica, accusing the government of \\u201ckidnapping\\u201d him, and demanding he be returned to the Philippines. Duterte\\u2019s supporters have argued that, as the Philippines withdrew from the Rome statute in 2019, the ICC no longer has jurisdiction. However, the court has previously said it retains jurisdiction for alleged crimes that occurred in the country before its withdrawal. The country\\u2019s president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who once ran in an alliance with vice-president Sara Duterte but is now embroiled in a bitter feud with the family, told reporters this week he was confident \\u201cthe arrest was proper, correct and followed all necessary legal procedures\\u201d.\",\n          \"Schools are hiring handwriting specialists to tackle a drop-off in children\\u2019s pen skills caused by the use of laptops and tablets during the pandemic and a lack of opportunities for extended writing. When children return in September, many will spend extra time with the specialists, and also occupational therapists who will be employed specifically to help children who have fallen behind. \\u201cIt is very clear that the pandemic has had a huge impact on learning,\\u201d said Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. \\u201cThe latest evidence on this was key stage 2 SATs results, which showed that the percentage of pupils achieving the expected standard in writing, maths, grammar, punctuation and spelling was quite markedly down on 2019 before the pandemic began. In the case of writing, it was nearly 10% lower.\\u201d Lockdowns compelled millions of children to do schoolwork at home on laptops and tablets, typing instead of writing. Waves of staff and pupil absences when children were back at school caused further disruption and have taken their toll on handwriting skills. \\u201cThe sounding out of letters and the mapping of that sound to a movement on paper is really quite complex when you are young and learning, so that means explicit teaching,\\u201d said Dr Mellissa Prunty, a senior lecturer in occupational therapy at Brunel University London and chair of the National Handwriting Association. \\u201cChildren need to be taught how to write. They don\\u2019t just pick it up. It really needs to be practised, and the problem during the pandemic is that writing dropped off a cliff. \\u201d To try to tackle the problem, schools are using one-off government Covid catch-up premium funding or national tutoring funding. The latter will see \\u00a3349m going directly to schools in 2022-23. It will cover 75% of the cost of tuition, with schools having to find the other 25%. Mill Lane primary school in Stockton-on-Tees has used its catch-up premium to employ a specialist writing teacher in order to accelerate progress in writing. At King Athelstan school in Kingston, greater London, a specialist teacher has provided phonics intervention three times a week to recap sounds taught in reception and link this to handwriting. Writing support for children in years 5 and 6 at St Peter and St Paul Church of England primary, in Bexhill, Sussex, is being delivered by a specialist teacher working alongside classroom teachers to provide high-quality tuition in writing for classes and groups. Learning loss interventions at Grasmere primary school in Hackney also include addressing the deterioration in handwriting. A new scheme at Brunel University will see occupational therapy students going on placements to local primaries specifically to help children who have fallen behind in writing. \\u201cThe government has invested \\u00a34.9bn into supporting education recovery since 2020-21, which we very much welcome.

Things clicked into place when she made her first short, Nits, a multi-award winning heart-tug of a film that earned a prestigious slot in Cannes. \\u201cI remember standing on set, looking at the actress and thinking, this is perfect,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI get to act through someone else. I don\\u2019t have to be the focus. It was a revelation really.\\u201d It\\u2019s perhaps because of her experience as an actor that Wootliff brings such an acute emotional intelligence to her work with her stars. We meet in London\\u2019s Soho, around the corner from the post-production studio where Wootliff is editing two episodes of the ITV series Deep Water. Warm and funny, with a ready laugh, she says the idea behind her feature debut, Only You (due out in the summer), was to tell \\u201ca contemporary relationship story, where you really see what goes on behind closed doors. I wanted the problem between them to be that they couldn\\u2019t conceive a child. At the time, I was trying to get pregnant. At the beginning of development, I didn\\u2019t have a baby; by the time we shot, I had a two-year-old. So partly I was tapping into how I felt.\\u201d It\\u2019s an intimate, stingingly honest film driven by two extraordinary performances. Laia Costa, fresh from carrying the German single-shot thriller Victoria, plays Elena, a Spanish woman in her mid-30s, living and working in Glasgow. She meets postgrad student Jake (Josh O\\u2019Connor, who dazzled in God\\u2019s Own Country) by chance, when they argue over a taxi on New Year\\u2019s Eve. The connection is instant. And despite a 10-year age gap, they start a relationship that feels just right. But their happy-ever-after story involves a wish for children. For Wootliff, representation is a key issue \\u2013 it\\u2019s not good enough just to see more women\\u2019s stories in cinema. \\u201cObviously there\\u2019s a new wave of feminism. But I sometimes think it\\u2019s all about showing women to be very strong. I like my character because she\\u2019s a lot of things: she\\u2019s vulnerable, irrational, funny. That\\u2019s a woman. We have qualities that are deemed as less admirable \\u2013 perhaps because we are in a male-dominated society \\u2013 so why shouldn\\u2019t we see them?\\u201d Wendy Ide Science: Anna Perdrix Rosell Anna Perdrix Rosell admits that she was always destined to become a scientist, ever since she first learned to operate a microscope at the age of five. As a child growing up in northern Spain, Perdrix Rosell would spend many hours poring over everything from blood spots to bits of vegetables, fascinated by the intricate patterns of the tiny cells. \\u201cMy dad and I would collect samples together,\\u201d she remembers. \\u201cHe had his own company, developing forms of pest control for agriculture, but he was a frustrated biologist at heart.\\u201d Two decades on, Perdrix Rosell is one of Europe\\u2019s leading young scientists, having launched her own startup, Sixfold Bioscience \\u2013 which aims to improve the way we deliver treatments to cancer patients \\u2013 as well as undertaking a PhD at the Francis Crick Institute in London, all by the age of 26. But her journey to the frontiers of cancer medicine was initially fuelled by family tragedy. She recalls the time that her uncle and aunt were both diagnosed with cancer, when she was 15. \\u201cShe\\u2019s still with us, but he died soon after he was diagnosed,\\u201d she says. \\u201cSince then, I\\u2019ve been determined to pursue cancer research.\\u201d With Sixfold, she is hoping to change the way we treat different cancer types. Instead of defining tumours by their location in the body, Perdrix Rosell believes we should characterise them based on the receptors on the surface of the cell membrane, and use this to deliver drugs exclusively to cancer cells, without affecting healthy cells. Along with Sixfold\\u2019s co-founders George Foot and Zuzanna Brzosko, she has started to test her theories on lab mice. Sixfold\\u2019s tiny nanoparticles are used to deliver high doses of medication directly to various tumours \\u2013 ranging from colorectal cancer to forms of brain and lung cancer \\u2013 all of which have a common surface receptor. If this succeeds during 2019, she hopes to fast-track her treatments into human trials. Her ideas have already captured the imagination of several Silicon Valley and UK investors, and Perdrix Rosell aims to raise more financial backing during the next funding round. In the meantime, there is the small matter of finishing her PhD, and perhaps squeezing in a rare moment to chill out. \\u201cI basically have two full-time jobs at the moment, and I simply have no time,\\u201d she laughs. \\u201cWhen I do have free time, I sleep!\\u201d David Cox Food: Rachel Ama Four years ago, when Rachel Ama gave up meat, fish, eggs and dairy more or less overnight after watching online documentaries exposing cruelty in animal agriculture, she received a lot of raised eyebrows from her friends and family. \\u201cNo one around me was vegan,\\u201d she recalls, \\u201cand everyone was constantly asking me, \\u2018Rachel, what are you eating? I don\\u2019t understand.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018Guys, my food is good, I promise \\u2013 it\\u2019s not just kale and celery.\\u2019\\u201d The bemusement of her peers provided valuable fuel for what happened next. \\u201cI wanted to get people in my social circles to see that what I was making was really tasty,\\u201d Ama tells me when we meet at her family home in north London. \\u201cSo I said, \\u2018You know what, I\\u2019m going to go on YouTube and share it.\\u2019\\u201d She posted her first video in September 2017. Now Ama has 140,000 subscribers, a fact that didn\\u2019t escape the publishers Ebury, who offered the 27-year-old a book deal last August. Ama\\u2019s appeal is obvious. She is a natural on air, full of personality, spontaneity and a willingness to be, as she puts it, \\u201ca bit weird\\u201d (she does a lot of singing and dancing to camera). It also helps that her food is delicious. Sitting in the white-tiled kitchen where she films all her videos, we tuck into a west African peanut curry \\u2013 one of her mum\\u2019s favourites \\u2013 with sweet potato instead of chicken and lashings of peanut butter for richness. Her take on Caribbean fritters, using jackfruit in place of salt fish, tastes uncannily like the original \\u2013 she adds a bit of nori to give it a maritime kick. The meal is rounded off with a boozy rum cake that dispenses with the eggs but, gratifyingly, doesn\\u2019t skimp on the rum. Ama\\u2019s book, to be published in June, will feature veganised dishes from her London upbringing, such as lasagne and kebabs, but it\\u2019s the Afro-Caribbean influences that give her food real colour and kick, setting her apart from the ever-growing crowd of vegan influencers, authors and broadcasters. \\u201cMy dad\\u2019s side is Caribbean, my mum is half-African, half-Welsh,\\u201d she says, \\u201cso there were always diverse cultures and food conversations at home. I grew up around different spices and exciting flavours. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m used to. Now I\\u2019m just doing it with vegetables and making it really tasty.\\u201d Killian Fox Art: Sean Edwards In a suburban garden in Cardiff, past discarded toys and a blue plastic slide, is the studio of the artist representing Wales at the 2019 Venice Biennale. A DIY wooden structure full of random objects and scrawled notes (\\u201cnot expecting much\\u201d; \\u201cdissapointing [sic] rather than specatcular [sic]\\u201d), it suits Sean Edwards\\u2019s aesthetic. A 38-year-old sculptor with a stunning CV (an MA from the Slade School of Fine Art, solo exhibitions behind him in London, Berlin and Bristol), Edwards is also a \\u201cvery dyslexic\\u201d father of two, brought up by a single mother on a Cardiff council estate in the 1980s. His work explores the sculptural possibilities of objects in ordinary people\\u2019s lives, often by using multimedia. His breakthrough 2010 solo show, Maelfa, was about the brutalist shopping centre he lived near as a child, incorporating a silent film, photographs, prints, models and ephemera. Another project, on Bruce Springsteen\\u2019s Nebraska, saw Edwards presenting his notebooks instead of anything grander, because this felt \\u201cmore honest\\u201d. \\u201cI like closing in on small details,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThey often have the potential to tell us about bigger things on a wider scale.\\u201d Sculpture shouldn\\u2019t just be about \\u201cchipping away at huge things with a hammer, anyway\\u201d, he adds. \\u201cIt should be about people experiencing objects in a space, and being drawn into them.\\u201d Edwards\\u2019s Biennale project broaches new territory, however: it includes a theatre piece, which involves him working with National Theatre Wales. He won\\u2019t reveal more about his \\u201cpoetic inquiry into place, politics and class, intertwined with personal histories\\u201d that will open in Venice in May, but his ongoing interest in the topic of disappointment has a place, and a memory of being put into a different line for free school meals mirrors some sketches on the studio wall. \\u201cI am a working artist because of university grants, Arts Council funding and money from the Welsh government,\\u201d he smiles. Edwards also loves being an artist in Cardiff, having worked with the g39 artist-run space in the city; he also teaches at the Cardiff School of Art and Design, where he was an undergraduate. \\u201cIt\\u2019s really exciting here. I see this in Birmingham and Liverpool as well \\u2013 there are more opportunities in smaller cities, and the costs aren\\u2019t astronomical. People forget that smaller places can be the most interesting, really.\\u201d It\\u2019s certainly a philosophy he lives by. Jude Rogers Theatre: Lynette Linton It looks like 2019 will be busy for Lynette Linton. Having just opened Lynn Nottage\\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning Sweat at the Donmar Warehouse in London to five-star reviews, the director and writer is set to take over from Madani Younis as artistic director of west London\\u2019s Bush theatre. She\\u2019s also curating Passages at the Royal Court in April, a day celebrating the Windrush generation; it\\u2019s a subject close to her heart, as her father came to Britain from Guyana when he was 12. Not bad for a 28-year-old who only got into theatre about seven years ago. \\u201cI\\u2019m working class, I wasn\\u2019t raised in theatre,\\u201d Linton says. \\u201cI grew up in a council house in Leytonstone. My dad would always say \\u2018stay in your job at John Lewis, you\\u2019ve got to have money coming in\\u2019. I remember going, is theatre the right thing for me? Is there anyone else like me that\\u2019s done this? There were, and there are \\u2013 look at what\\u2019s happening in the industry now.\\u201d Linton is part of a wave of newly appointed artistic directors reflecting the industry\\u2019s attempts to diversify, from Kwame Kwei-Armah at the Young Vic to Nadia Fall at Theatre Royal Stratford East \\u2013 Linton\\u2019s local, which staged her plays Step and Chicken Palace. Her mission is to widen theatre\\u2019s appeal in terms of age, race and class. Linton laughs at how everyone says she\\u2019s \\u201cso young\\u201d to run a building; this should be an asset when tackling why young audiences don\\u2019t go to the theatre. \\u201cEverybody goes to the cinema \\u2013 and cinema\\u2019s really expensive!\\u201d she points out, adding that she does get why young, diverse audiences may feel unwelcome: the people sitting in the stalls are often overwhelmingly white and old. Sometimes, she says, she feels out of place even watching her own shows. With Sweat, particularly, it\\u2019s important to her that \\u201cit\\u2019s not just seen by the same people that watch every Donmar show\\u201d. The play tells the story of a group of friends pitted against one another when their jobs at a factory in Reading, Pennsylvania are threatened. Brexit parallels will, Linton says, be obvious. \\u201cMy whole thing is unheard voices \\u2013 that\\u2019s why I got into theatre, because people like me aren\\u2019t represented. When I heard about Lynn Nottage, that\\u2019s what she does,\\u201d she says. \\u201cTheatre is a medium for everybody: we need to make sure all those stories are heard.\\u201d Holly Williams Jazz: Steam Down Orchestra If 2018 was the year that the world\\u2019s ears tuned to the UK jazz underground, a must-attend midweek jam session in Deptford, south London, is where its spirit was celebrated. At Steam Down, spiritual jazz and west African rhythms are twisted up with future soul, grime and Afrofuturist spoken word about utopias without Oyster cards. Entry is by donation so that anyone can afford to go. The musicians in the Steam Down Orchestra play on the floor at eye level, dissolving the barrier between band and fan, with whatever big-name guest rolls through that week. The superstar saxophonist Kamasi Washington loves it so much he\\u2019s turned up and joined in twice. The first rule of Steam Down is \\u201cdon\\u2019t be afraid to move your body\\u201d, says saxophonist Wayne Francis, the collective\\u2019s de facto spokesperson who goes by the stage name Ahnans\\u00e9. Key to the night is the energy between performers and the crowd. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about taking part,\\u201d says Francis. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not really about being a spectator.\\u201d Since Steam Down took their live show to the Jazz Cafe in October, their flagship night in Deptford has been a roadblock every week and become a focal point for the UK jazz scene. The band totals 12 players, including Sons of Kemet members Eddie Hick and Theon Cross (four were away when we took our photograph). But despite these jazz credentials, Steam Down find the term too limiting. \\u201cI don\\u2019t feel UK jazz is a broad enough category for us,\\u201d says Francis. \\u201cWe were playing some trap last night!\\u201d Musical fluidity is \\u201cintegral\\u201d to Steam Down, as is improvisation. \\u201cNo song is fixed.\\u201d Until now, Steam Down haven\\u2019t had to release anything to get bookings. \\u201cInstagram is our album,\\u201d says Francis. \\u201cYou go to #steamdown, check out the clips and catch the feeling.\\u201d Or you can text their \\u201chotline\\u201d for details of shows and special guests, which has helped cultivate a dedicated community of more than 800 people (that\\u2019s the total number in their phonebook). But they are finally going to record their music in January and it makes sense that it\\u2019ll be during a three-hour live performance. A Mercury nomination \\u201cwould be nice\\u201d, but it\\u2019s not a measure for Steam Down\\u2019s success. \\u201cIf someone said, \\u2018Steam Down helped me go through grieving after I lost my dad\\u2019,\\u201d says Francis, \\u201cit\\u2019s at the top of the list of achievements.\\u201d Kate Hutchinson Steam Down\\u2019s weekly nights at Buster Mantis, Deptford, south London, will return in February TV: Niamh Algar Landing a lead role in the writer-director Shane Meadows\\u2019s new TV series was a dream come true for Niamh Algar. \\u201cI\\u2019m a major fan of Shane\\u2019s work,\\u201d says the Irish actor from Mullingar. \\u201cI\\u2019m the youngest of five and when I was 15, one of the first DVDs I robbed off my older brothers was This Is England. I\\u2019d never seen anything like it. It was a different beast to Dawson\\u2019s Creek or the romcoms I\\u2019d been watching. Shane\\u2019s a genius, so to be auditioning for him, let alone get the part, was mindblowing.\\u201d That part is opposite a Meadows regular \\u2013 Stephen Graham \\u2013 in the incendiary four-parter The Virtues. They play Dinah and Joseph, two lost souls whose paths cross when Joseph confronts the demons that haunt him from a childhood in care. Algar fulfilled another ambition in co-starring with Graham: \\u201cWhen I studied drama at the Factory in Dublin, we used to workshop scenes between Combo and Lol from This Is England. So suddenly to be working opposite Steve was amazing. I didn\\u2019t tell him that, obviously. Wouldn\\u2019t want to give him a big head.\\u201d Algar will be all over our TVs in 2019. Before The Virtues starts in late spring, later this month she\\u2019ll star in Channel 4\\u2019s Pure about an extreme form of OCD called \\u201cpure O\\u201d. After last year\\u2019s role in Desiree Akhavan\\u2019s The Bisexual, Pure is Algar\\u2019s second gay character in a row. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s because Shane made me shave off half my hair and dye it bleached blond, so I look quite edgy. I\\u2019m delighted if that\\u2019s become my niche!\\u201d Later this year, we\\u2019ll see her play an army veteran in the BBC thriller MotherFatherSon, starring Richard Gere in his first major small-screen role. \\u201cOn my first day, I got a scene with the back of his head,\\u201d she laughs. \\u201cI tell you what, that man has great hair.\\u201d What does Algar do on her days off? \\u201cA lot of boxing. I\\u2019ve sparred since my teens. I\\u2019d love to use it in a role. I text my agent pretty much daily going, \\u2018Any boxing films?\\u2019\\u201d Algar doesn\\u2019t get recognised yet. \\u201cNo one has a clue who I am,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s great. Except when I go home to Ireland and my family are like, \\u2018Hmm, you look familiar. You\\u2019re the youngest, aren\\u2019t you?\\u201d She rolls her eyes. \\u201cI only moved away two years ago. Families, eh?\\u201d Michael Hogan Books: Emma Dabiri When Emma Dabiri was seven, instead of attending her first holy communion with her classmates, she created a \\u201cspiffy little anti-slavery pamphlet called Break the Chains\\u201d and presented it to her teachers. \\u201cAs soon as you start reading black history, it\\u2019s difficult not to become politicised,\\u201d she says, sipping a coffee in the Hoxton Holborn hotel. \\u201cI started reading it very young. I experienced a lot of racism as a child, and reading about the global black struggle helped me contextualise what was happening to me.\\u201d Growing up in 1980s Dublin to a white Trinidadian-born Irish mother and black Irish-Nigerian father, it\\u2019s no surprise that the social historian, broadcaster, former model and soon-to-be published author has interests that span pop culture, race, feminism and Yoruba folklore. Thanks to her presenting work on programmes such as Channel 4\\u2019s Is Love Racist? and BBC Two\\u2019s Back in Time for Brixton, she has become known for straddling the line between academia and accessibility. Dabiri says she has been on this path for as long as she can remember, but her first significant step was leaving Ireland for a place at Soas University of London. She did a degree in African studies, followed by a master\\u2019s in development. After a stint working in Ghana, Dabiri found herself back at Soas, teaching and working on a PhD. She started writing a blog, and in 2013 wrote a post for Media Diversified titled Who Stole All the Black Women from Britain? It\\u2019s this piece that she cites as launching her into the public-facing world. Much like contemporary Afua Hirsch, Dabiri\\u2019s voice has been a refreshing counterbalance in a country still struggling to acknowledge its racist past in a postcolonial world. Her forthcoming book Don\\u2019t Touch My Hair is written \\u201cfirst and foremost\\u201d for those with afro hair: Dabiri, whose hair is more coiled than loosely curled, says: \\u201cI think if I had the \\u2018typical\\u2019 [loose] hair that\\u2019s associated with being mixed race, I would actually be a very different person.\\u201d Situated wittily in Dabiri\\u2019s own story, the book starts by tackling hair-texture discrimination, a phenomenon that goes hand in hand with colourism. Later chapters explore hair in relation to African mathematics, mapping and coding, and include fascinating stories of how slaves used braiding to communicate. The book, to be published in May, is likely to shift many stale conversations, and prove that black people\\u2019s concerns around hair are anything but superficial. Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff Pop: Yellow Days \\u201cI can\\u2019t switch off from music,\\u201d says George van den Broek, the 19-year-old multi-instrumentalist from Haslemere in Surrey who records as Yellow Days. \\u201cIt\\u2019s my life. I\\u2019ve been working in this capacity for three years now and I think I\\u2019m becoming incredibly old-mannish.\\u201d He laughs. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very slowly sucking the youth out of me.\\u201d Van den Broek has a hefty back catalogue for a teenager, with an EP and an album, 2017\\u2019s Is Everything OK in Your World?, already in circulation. In both, he mined a down-tempo indie-R&amp;B groove with low-key but compelling results, building up a youthful following on both sides of the Atlantic. (Donald Glover used a Yellow Days track in the season two trailer for his hit TV show Atlanta.) But now, in his first releases since signing to a major label, his music is taking a (relatively) upbeat turn. The mellow sweetness that ran through the earlier records is amplified on recent singles such as How Can I Love You? He says the album he is working on now will be his \\u201cfunky record\\u201d, moulded by deep immersion in \\u201c70s crossover jazz-funk and artists like Leroy Hutson, Al Green, and the Originals\\u201d. In person, Van den Broek is a genial presence who swans into a cafe in north London 30 minutes late wearing a big smile and a long-sleeved T-shirt inspired by The Simpsons. Contrary to what his music might have you believe, he grew up in what he describes as \\u201ca very lovely, happy, supportive background\\u201d. \\u201cAll the strife and pain has come through my own stupid little life,\\u201d he says, smiling ruefully. \\u201cMy family are like a warm sofa that hugs you.\\u201d They supported his musical ambitions, which took root at 14 when he started writing \\u201cgood\\u201d music (as opposed to the \\u201cterrible Ed Sheeran stuff\\u201d he\\u2019d come up with in earlier years). As well as singing, playing guitar and producing, he\\u2019s taught himself to play bass, keyboards, drums and a bit of sax. Making music is hard work, van den Broek insists, but he can\\u2019t imagine doing anything else, even if it saps the youth out of him. \\u201cI would have really struggled to let go of childish dreams,\\u201d he tells me. \\u201cSo I\\u2019m eternally grateful for the decisions I made to bring me to this point and I\\u2019m going to keep giving it everything I\\u2019ve got.\\u201d Killian Fox Activism: Amatey Doku Amatey Doku\\u2019s career in student representation had humble beginnings. As a member of his secondary school\\u2019s student council, he campaigned for better food options in the canteen. \\u201cMy understanding of politics in a broader sense wasn\\u2019t very good at the time, but I\\u2019ve always tried to make things better for people,\\u201d he says. Since then, Doku has broadened his scope. Now 23, he is the vice-president for higher education at the National Union of Students (NUS) and a member of For Our Future\\u2019s Sake, a student campaign group calling for a people\\u2019s vote on the Brexit deal. In October, he was one of the speakers at the 700,000-strong march for a new Brexit referendum in central London. \\u201cFor me, standing on that stage, seeing those crowds of people and the passion behind the campaign was really moving,\\u201d he says. His current role has also given him the opportunity to have his say within parliament \\u2013 he has twice given evidence at committee meetings on funding for higher education. At Cambridge University, where Doku graduated with a degree in sociology in 2016, he was president of his college\\u2019s union and later president of the university students\\u2019 union. Among the issues he advocated for was a campaign to repatriate a statue at the university that had been looted from Africa in the 19th century. He came from an academic family \\u2013 his grandfather is a professor at the University of Ghana and his father studied medicine in the UK \\u2013 and so expectations were always high. \\u201cMy parents put a lot of emphasis on being educated, especially being black,\\u201d he says. But, after learning of the black attainment gap in education through his studies, he felt a strong obligation to clear the path for others. \\u201cI understand the huge privilege I gained from going to Cambridge. You\\u2019ve got to make sure you use that to make change.\\u201d In the long term, Doku hasn\\u2019t ruled out moving on to national politics: he is a staunch believer that our political system needs simplifying so it can be more easily understood by the public. But he won\\u2019t be taking the plunge any time soon. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s important that people going into politics have some experience of the real world,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI\\u2019d much rather work in the third sector, at charities or organisations that are trying to effect change, before that.\\u201d Amy Walker\",\n          \"I read with interest your support for Yvette Cooper et al and their proposal for a town of culture (Editorial, 31 December). While mentioning just Oldham and Margate as towns that have developed a cultural footprint despite having suffered urban decline, the citing of Aldeburgh, Hay-on-Wye, Wigtown and Stroud as the other four likely contenders surely misses the point. While the UK\\u2019s major cities have all reinvented themselves as cultural destinations over the past 30 years or so, their neighbouring (often former industrial) towns have struggled for a share of voice and many have suffered a substantial decline as places to visit and as centres in which to live and work. The implication that a celebration of town-based culture should focus on highbrow festival towns and/or rural centres reflects a lack of imagination. Every deprived town, despite economic challenges, will have a mix of (often hidden) activity in music, performing and visual arts and wider cultural engagement \\u2013 which could be boosted by a town of culture award (or similar). While not wishing to disappoint the less-than-impoverished residents of Hay and Aldeburgh, it is in towns like Pontefract and Castleford (Ms Cooper\\u2019s constituency), and a host of centres across the UK with similar urban and cultural profiles, where town-focused initiatives must surely be targeted. Paul Baker Director, Vector Research Limited, Birmingham \\u2022 You write that \\u201cGlasgow\\u2019s year as European capital of culture [in 1990] can certainly be seen as one of a complex series of factors that have turned the city into the powerhouse of art, music and theatre that it remains today\\u201d. Perhaps a rather more important factor is that Glasgow was one of the twin cities of the Scottish Enlightenment. Glasgow was a powerhouse of art, music, theatre and culture for centuries before it was awarded the status of European capital of culture.

Colman\\u2019s Anne has been garnering attention and will likely be a contender for big awards \\u2013 but Stone (Abigail) and, particularly, Weisz (Sarah), as the favourites new and old, don\\u2019t deserve to be overshadowed. Mary Poppins Returns (U) (Rob Marshall, 2018, US) 130 mins This freshly scrubbed and sparkling update of Disney\\u2019s family favourite from 1964 suggests that Hollywood\\u2019s po-mo phase has come to an end. There\\u2019s barely any self-referentiality or reinvention on show here; it\\u2019s basically a throwback, as exact a replica as possible of the original. Not that there\\u2019s anything wrong with that. RBG (PG) (Julie Cohen, Betsy West, 2018, US) 98 mins Celebratory portrait of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the equality rights lawyer who is now a key veteran of the US supreme court \\u2013 and who has become a touchstone in digital culture, with blogs, Tumblrs and gifs by the bucketload dedicated to her. This doc, via copious interviews with RBG herself as well as legions of admirers, traces her path to the top as she is held to be America\\u2019s most enduring liberal conscience. The Passenger (15) (Michelangelo Antonioni, 1975, It/Sp/Fr) 125 mins The third in Antonioni\\u2019s English-language trilogy (following Blow-Up and Zabriskie Point) has developed a cult reputation over the decades. Jack Nicholson plays a reporter who acquires the identity of a dead man \\u2013 who turns out to be a gun runner with nasty people in tow. Maria Schneider, just a couple of years after Last Tango in Paris, plays a young student who helps him as he tries to evade his pursuers. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (PG) (Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman, 2018, US) 117 mins Novel and impressive attempt to refresh the Spider-Man franchise, at risk from drowning in reboots.

They had shown great chutzpah to beat Argentina after the hooter and they still carried the glow of last November\\u2019s win over England. This was a side developing shape and steel, a side capable of the sublime, a side beginning to coax long-dormant fans back to the code while tempting home several stars who had crossed to rugby league. This tour was supposed to confirm, unequivocally, that the Wallabies were back. Instead, they\\u2019ve gone backwards after a sorry performance against Ireland in Dublin where they received a 46\\u201319 shellacking that still managed to flatter them on the scoreboard. This result also confirms their status as a B-tier rugby team. No matter what happens against France in Paris next week, they will leave Europe ranked outside the top six on World Rugby\\u2019s charts, consigning them to the second pot when the 2027 World Cup draw takes place next month. The implications are stark: if the Wallabies want to reach the latter stages of their own tournament on home soil, they will have to knock over one of the giants, a task that, on current evidence, feels well beyond them. Too often in Dublin they looked like a side searching for someone else to take control: to claim the high ball, to marshal the defensive line, to calm a frantic moment, to dictate where the next five minutes should be played. Ireland didn\\u2019t overwhelm them physically or tactically. They simply leaned on the most obvious pressure points \\u2013 contestable kicks, structured phase play, tempo changes \\u2013 and trusted that the Wallabies would crack first. And they did. Australia coughed up possession from their own lineout on six occasions \\u2013 four times inside Ireland\\u2019s 22. Their ineptitude under the high ball has only worsened after similar struggles against England and Italy over the past fortnight. They\\u2019re playing like a team that has run out of energy, which is deeply concerning given they should be entering a new chapter as they gear up for that home World Cup in less than two years. What on earth are they going to do between now and then? First things first: they need to back someone, anyone, at fly-half. James O\\u2019Connor is a supremely gifted athlete. He looks the part too. His socks are down around his ankles, his angular jaw barks instructions to teammates as his sinewy arms wave about. But he is not the metronome this team requires. His inability to marshal the backline into something resembling a cohesive structure was telling. Not that this is O\\u2019Connor\\u2019s fault. In an ideal world, the 35-year-old who made his Test debut 17 years ago would have been watching this match like the rest of us. But Tane Edmed is far from the finished product, and Carter Gordon, while rediscovering his groove in the code, is sidelined with a neck injury. What Schmidt would give for a player like South Africa\\u2019s Handr\\u00e9 Pollard or England\\u2019s George Ford, two fly-halves who have copped their share of criticism for lacking razzle-dazzle, yet provide the one quality Australia are crying out for: control. Australia already have plenty of excitement and instinct and broken-field brilliance. What they\\u2019re missing is a first receiver who dictates the tempo of a Test match, who can put his studs on the ball and slow things down, who can take the sting out of the contest rather than add to the chaos. Under Schmidt, Australian rugby is steadier, but still too dependent on the sting. For Schmidt, this is a version of Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho\\u2019s undersized blanket problem: tug the defence into shape and the attack loses fluidity; focus on structure and the spark disappears; lean on spark and the control evaporates. Every time Australia cover one area, another is left exposed. The cruel irony is that this team\\u2019s ceiling remains genuinely high. But the floor keeps dropping out from beneath them. They don\\u2019t need to reinvent themselves, they need reliability, leadership and a spine that doesn\\u2019t buckle under pressure. The tour was supposed to be a statement of intent. Instead, it has served as a sobering reminder of how far behind the leading nations Australia still sit. Schmidt will speak of learnings and combinations and growth \\u2013 and some of that will be true \\u2013 but he knows better than anyone that this team requires more than incremental improvement. It needs identity, clarity and, crucially, a fly-half who can turn talent into Test-match shape. In the end it\\u2019s the clarity that will hurt most. Australia are not on the cusp of something; they are adrift from it. The raw materials are there, but the polish, the precision, the ruthlessness that defines the very best sides remains absent.\",\n          \"Former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte has said he will accept responsibility for his government\\u2019s so-called \\u201cwar on drugs\\u201d in a video message filmed on board a plane shortly before he was taken into the custody of the international criminal court (ICC). \\u201cWhatever happened in the past, I will be the front of our law enforcement and the military. I said this already, that I will protect you, and I will be responsible for everything,\\u201d he said. The video message, which appeared to have been filmed on board the aircraft that brought him to the Netherlands to face charges of crimes against humanity, were his first comments to the Philippines public since his dramatic arrest on Tuesday. Dressed in a plain white shirt, and speaking to the camera, he said: \\u201cThis will be a long legal proceeding. But I say to you, I will continue to serve the country. So be it. If that is my destiny. Thank you\\u201d. Duterte has previously said he offered \\u201cno apologies, no excuses\\u201d for his bloody anti drugs crackdowns which activists say may have killed as many as 30,000 people. Duterte\\u2019s plane landed at Rotterdam airport at just before 5pm local time on Wednesday, and he was transferred to a detention unit on the Dutch coast. In a statement the ICC confirmed it had taken custody of the former leader, with the court\\u2019s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, calling it \\u201ca crucial step in our continuous work to ensure accountability for the victims of the most serious crimes under ICC jurisdiction.\\u201d Duterte is the first former leader of an Asian country to be served an arrest warrant filed by the ICC. In a statement the ICC said its chamber, composed of three judges, had assessed material submitted by office of the prosecutor and found reasonable grounds to believe that Duterte is \\u201cindividually responsible as an indirect co-perpetrator for the crime against humanity of murder, allegedly committed in the Philippines between 1 November 2011 and 16 March 2019.\\u201d A hearing will be scheduled \\u201cin due course\\u201d for Duterte\\u2019s initial appearance before the court, it said, which will confirm his identity and the language in which he is able to follow the proceedings. It is not clear when a trial will begin. Supporters of the former leader gathered at The Hague Penitentiary Institution, waiving the Philippines flag and chanting \\u201cbring him back\\u201d. While rights experts and victims\\u2019 families have been overjoyed by the news of Duterte\\u2019s arrest, the former leader retains a strong support base, especially in the south of the country. \\u201cI am OK, do not worry,\\u201d Duterte, who will turn 80 this month, said in the video message. His daughter, Sara Duterte, the vice-president, also arrived in The Hague on Wednesday evening to offer support. Lawyers for Duterte on Wednesday filed a petition on behalf of his youngest daughter, Veronica, accusing the government of \\u201ckidnapping\\u201d him, and demanding he be returned to the Philippines. Duterte\\u2019s supporters have argued that, as the Philippines withdrew from the Rome statute in 2019, the ICC no longer has jurisdiction. However, the court has previously said it retains jurisdiction for alleged crimes that occurred in the country before its withdrawal. The country\\u2019s president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who once ran in an alliance with vice-president Sara Duterte but is now embroiled in a bitter feud with the family, told reporters this week he was confident \\u201cthe arrest was proper, correct and followed all necessary legal procedures\\u201d.\",\n          \"Schools are hiring handwriting specialists to tackle a drop-off in children\\u2019s pen skills caused by the use of laptops and tablets during the pandemic and a lack of opportunities for extended writing. When children return in September, many will spend extra time with the specialists, and also occupational therapists who will be employed specifically to help children who have fallen behind. \\u201cIt is very clear that the pandemic has had a huge impact on learning,\\u201d said Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. \\u201cThe latest evidence on this was key stage 2 SATs results, which showed that the percentage of pupils achieving the expected standard in writing, maths, grammar, punctuation and spelling was quite markedly down on 2019 before the pandemic began. In the case of writing, it was nearly 10% lower.\\u201d Lockdowns compelled millions of children to do schoolwork at home on laptops and tablets, typing instead of writing. Waves of staff and pupil absences when children were back at school caused further disruption and have taken their toll on handwriting skills. \\u201cThe sounding out of letters and the mapping of that sound to a movement on paper is really quite complex when you are young and learning, so that means explicit teaching,\\u201d said Dr Mellissa Prunty, a senior lecturer in occupational therapy at Brunel University London and chair of the National Handwriting Association. \\u201cChildren need to be taught how to write. They don\\u2019t just pick it up. It really needs to be practised, and the problem during the pandemic is that writing dropped off a cliff. \\u201d To try to tackle the problem, schools are using one-off government Covid catch-up premium funding or national tutoring funding. The latter will see \\u00a3349m going directly to schools in 2022-23. It will cover 75% of the cost of tuition, with schools having to find the other 25%. Mill Lane primary school in Stockton-on-Tees has used its catch-up premium to employ a specialist writing teacher in order to accelerate progress in writing. At King Athelstan school in Kingston, greater London, a specialist teacher has provided phonics intervention three times a week to recap sounds taught in reception and link this to handwriting. Writing support for children in years 5 and 6 at St Peter and St Paul Church of England primary, in Bexhill, Sussex, is being delivered by a specialist teacher working alongside classroom teachers to provide high-quality tuition in writing for classes and groups. Learning loss interventions at Grasmere primary school in Hackney also include addressing the deterioration in handwriting. A new scheme at Brunel University will see occupational therapy students going on placements to local primaries specifically to help children who have fallen behind in writing. \\u201cThe government has invested \\u00a34.9bn into supporting education recovery since 2020-21, which we very much welcome. However, we are not convinced that this is sufficient for the scale of the task,\\u201d said Barton.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 57,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Politics']\",\n          \"['International_Affairs', 'Politics']\",\n          \"['Science', 'Education']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Guardian\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 92294,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/16/the-wallabies-were-meant-to-prove-theyre-back-but-instead-they-have-gone-backwards\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"section\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"law\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"revised_labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label_cat_list\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
